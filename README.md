#### Cloning

- First, clone the repo with

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/asimbera/ccp-assignments.git
  ```

- Open project in Visual Studio Code with
  ```sh
  cd ccp-assignments
  code . -r
  ```
- Run any `*.c` file with opening the file in editor and press `F5` on keyboard.

  > Switch to integrated terminal to provide any input to the program.

- Each assignment have its own latex documentation. You can generate pdf from `*.latex` by
  ```sh
  pdflatex  -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode -file-line-error -outdir=. -shell-escape README.tex
  ```
  > You must have `latex-most` package installed on your system and must be on path.
  > Update the `cover.tex` file in subject level directory to get you details on the front page.
